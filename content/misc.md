### About this website

It created using Zola SSG and plain css with ~Alan Sans~ Instrument Sans typeface. The website inspired from fhur.me and terriblesoftware.org. 

The site design aiming for neat, soft and direct yet sometime felt empty and cold.

Purpose of this site is for sharing thing I find interesting, reminder about I have through and my portofolio. 

Maybe not only about computer stuff, there maybe random personal things, that actually personal blog does :p

### Me?

A mid-twenties computer programmer from third-world country, an atheist/humanist in populous religious country, computer nerd, weeb with lot anime pics, somewhat nihilistic somewhat pessimistic somewhat misanthropic somewhat absurdism, perhaps autistic, books.
