I think she doesn't like me. The chat feels dry.
Insercurites are coming back. Female interaction is important.
Maybe i should ask her about the mallu girl.  
Its like beginning of 1st sem all over again. I dont know most the people in my class. Its scary.
I cant live like this. I need to tell her or get a gf.
She prolly sees me a another guy. Why did she talk to me that day. Why did she smile like at me. Mann, when i look into her eyes, it feels like im gonna fall into those big black eyes.   
Shit shes cute.  
I hope i get a girl like that. 
If i see her again im gonna tell her. I dont care if it affects whatever we have now between us. Are we friends ? i mean we message each other. Sometimes it feels she is interested. But its mostly me asking dried up quesitons. Feels like shes bored. I mean i am a boring guy.  
Fuck college is just gonna be like high school. The only difference is i wont be fat. I would be skinny fat. I want to talk to girls. Why is it so hard. How can she talk so many guys. I guess its easy when you are beautiful. aah im so average. i fucking hate my photos. 
I wanna tell her that she looks cute in her instagram profile. It makes me smile.
